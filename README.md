# Cricket_score_and_updates_using_python_script

Python Script to get Cricket score and updates as an SMS and notification.


I used notify2, cricbuzz module and Twilio API in this script. To use this script first you have to make account on Communication APIs for SMS, Voice, Video and Authentication (Twilio website) to get the accountSid, authToken and myTwilioNumber.
